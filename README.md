## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an automated anomaly detection system that identifies unusual market movements in real-time by analyzing historical stock data from 10 major Indian companies. The system provides investors with actionable insights through statistical validation, correlation analysis, and forecasting capabilities.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Z-Score analysis for price anomalies and volume spike detection
- **Interactive Dashboard**: R Shiny application with dynamic visualizations
- **Statistical Validation**: Comprehensive testing (ADF, KPSS, Shapiro-Wilk, Jarque-Bera)
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Correlation heatmaps and diversification insights
- **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA models with confidence intervals
- **Sector-wise Analysis**: Comparative analysis across different market sectors

## üìä Key Findings

### Anomaly Detection Performance:
- Banking stocks showed highest anomaly frequencies (ICICI Bank: 56, SBI: 61)
- FMCG stocks demonstrated lowest anomaly rates (ITC: 19, HUL: 23)
- Volume spikes frequently preceded significant price movements
- Strong sector-based correlation clustering observed

### Statistical Insights:
- COVID-19 period exhibited 3-5√ó normal volatility levels
- ARIMA models achieved 8-12% MAPE for 30-day forecasts
- Banking sector offers limited diversification benefits
- Defensive FMCG stocks provide valuable diversification during downturns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Methodology:
- **Z-Score Analysis**: Identifies abnormal returns beyond ¬±3 standard deviations using 20-day rolling windows
- **Volume Spike Detection**: Flags unusual trading activity (Volume > 2.5√ó 20-day average)
- **Volatility Monitoring**: 20-day rolling standard deviation of returns
- **Statistical Tests**: Stationarity (ADF, KPSS), Normality (Shapiro-Wilk, Jarque-Bera), Autocorrelation (ACF)
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Auto ARIMA with 95% confidence intervals

### Technologies Used:
- **R** with Shiny framework
- **tidyquant** for financial data from Yahoo Finance API
- **plotly** for interactive visualizations
- **forecast** for time series analysis
- **tseries** for statistical testing
